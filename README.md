[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/greenelab/scrum.svg?token=7FyZyp7bN9WxFnsviy1B&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/greenelab/scrum)

This repository is home to the Greene Lab's electronic [scrum](http://greenelab-onboarding.readthedocs.io/en/latest/communication.html?highlight=scrum) (e-scrum).
Scrums occur via [issues](https://github.com/greenelab/scrum/issues) using GitHub flavored markdown and its [task lists interface](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments).

The [**@scrum-lord**](https://github.com/scrum-lord) is a machine user who maintains the issues via daily Travis CI cron jobs.
