# The e-scrum pilot initiative

This repository is home the Greene Lab's e-scrum pilot program. Currently, the idea is to investigate whether scrum reporting can occur via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/greenelab/scrum/issues) and its [task lists interface](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments).
